Homework – Topic 6 – Calculator:

Write a program which allows the user to perform simple tasks on a calculator. A series of methods allows the user to select an operation to perform and then enter operands.
The first method displays a menu, giving the user the choice
of typing in any one
+, -,*,/,or% A
X M S Q
of the following:
representing the usual arithmetic operators representing the average of two numbers representing the maximum of two numbers representing the minimum of two numbers representing the square of a number indicating the user wants to quit the program
The program reads the user's response into a variable of type char. Using a switch statement, the program determines which method to call to process the user's request. For example, if the user enters +, a method is called which prompts the user to enter two integers. The method then finds the sum of the two integers and the method prints the results of the operation. If the user enters X, a method asks for two integers and finds the larger of the two. If the user enters S, a method asks for one value and finds the square of that value. If the user enters Q, the program stops.
For each calculation performed, the method prints the operation requested, the user's original input, and the result.
Note: All output must be sent to a file
Note: The program must be properly tested
Note: The program will iterate until the user quits the program
Sample Output:
Operation: addition
augend: 25
addend: 35
sum: 60
Required Submission:
1. The Java source code file (e.g., HW6.java)
2. The test cases input file (e.g., testCases.txt)
3. The program generated output file (e.g., output.txt)
